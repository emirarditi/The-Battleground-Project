# The-Battleground-Project

  This is my first major project which I developed for my CS102 class. It is far from the best project I can create right now but it is always good to remember where you are coming from. I created this project with Batuhan Erden.
  
  Notes: 
    the sound files are too large to upload so I didn't include them. For the project to run properly, you can add 2 music files called intro.wav and battle.wav
